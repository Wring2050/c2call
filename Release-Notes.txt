IMPORTANT NOTE:
When adding SocialCommunication.resources, two additional steps have to be done:

A NEW DATAMODEL VERSION HAS BEEN ADDED:
1. Seek for C2CallDataModel and select the current data model as: C2CallDataModel 17.xcdatamodel
Sometimes, the wrong C2CallDataModel is pre-selected, which causes a crash.

2. Please manually add the following files to your "Copy Bundle Resources" section in your Application Target Build Phases:
    myshader.vsh
    myshader.fsh
Just seek for myshader and drag&drop it into your "Copy Bundle Resources" section. This is important as the files will not be copied into your Application Bundle by default at compile time.
The video call does not work in this case.
3. When updating from an older version of the SDK, please check your Framework Search Path in the Build Settings and remove any path component linking to an older version of the SDK. Otherwise you might still use the old version, as XCode is linking frameworks in the order of the Framework Search Path.

C2Call Social Communication SDK V 0.9.9 (Beta) Release Notes
IMPORTANT for Build 41
- Support for Opus Codec for HD Audio. Significantly improved audio quality in VoIP and video calls.

IMPORTANT for Build 30
The SCStoryboard7.storyboard, which used to the the storyboard for iOS7 with autolayout has now been renamed to SCStoryboard.storyboard.
The old non-autolayout storyboard has been renamed to SCStoryboard6.storyboard. It will not longer be updated with the next SDK releases.
Please update your App to support autolayout.

New Features:
- Support for tunneling of UDP packets via single port 80 TCP connection.
Typically VoIP communication will be done via UDP connection-less data transmission for SIP and RTP packets.
Sometimes, in public WIFI or coprporate WIFI enviroments, the Firewall blocks UDP data which doesn't allow the connection to the C2Call service.
As fallback, the SDK will now establish a TCP Tunnel over port 80 and transmit all UDP data through this tunnel connection. 
The tunnel will add additional delay on a connection, but at least the connection will be available under such difficult firewall conditions.
- SIPPhone : New Methods
    +(void) setUDPTunnelHost:(NSString *) tunnelHost andPort:(int) tunnelPort;
    Static Method, to set a different defualt Tunnel Server and Port (must be a C2Call SDK complient Tunnel Server)
    +(void) setForceTunnel:(BOOL) force;
    Force a Tunnel Connection (for Testing only, not for Production)
    +(void) setDisableTunnel:(BOOL) disable;
    Disable the Tunnel. The SDK will not try to establish a tunnel, in case the normal connection fails.
    -(BOOL) isUDPTunnelActive;
    Tunnel Status
    -(BOOL) forceTunnel;
    Is tunnel forced.

Bugfixes (Fixed Bugs reported by Forum users):

- Flurry logging methods should always be called on the C2CallAppDelegate. (NoOffers-RadiumOne and NoOffers-SponsorPay)
- Lowering the the SDK's memory footprint.
- Async vs sync HTTP requests.([C2CallConnection getAffiliateInfo] or [FlurryAdList imageForAd])

C2Call Social Communication SDK V 0.9.3 (Beta) Release Notes
New Features:
- New SCPurchaseController allows to simply integrate Apple In-App purchase for purchasing call credits.
In order to use In-App purchase, please follow the Apple StoreKit guide. The SCPurchaseController uses the SCStoreObserver class to process In-App purchase transactions.
The correct initalization of SCStoreObserver class is required to use the SCPurchaseController.
Step to initialize the SCStoreObserver:

1. Create your App in iTunes Connect
2. After creating the App, go to "Manage In-App purchase" and create one or more consumable product items
3. In XCode open your AppDelegate class and add the following lines to applicationDidFinishLoading:withOptions:
    SCStoreObserver *observer = [SCStoreObserver new];
    // Use addConsumableProduct for any product you create
    [observer addConsumableProduct:@"<Your Product ID>" creditValue:<Credit Value for the User in Cent> currency:SC_CURRENCY_USD];
4. All products will automatically appear in SCPurchaseController for purchase.
5. In case of purchasing a product, the user will receive the defined credit value in his account. Those credit will be deducted from the developers master account. Therefore, the master account must have always enough credit to cover any purchase transactions.

- New customization options for SCChatController and SCBoardController. The actually message bubbles can now be customized in shape and color using UIAppearance API 
Please refer to the class reference documentation of SCBubbleViewIn and SCBubbleViewOut
We currently provide 4 different bubble shapes and will add more in the near future
In order to customize the bubbles, please add the following lines in your AppDelegate applicationDidFinishLaunching:withOptions:

    // Set the Bubble Shape to iOS7 style
    [[SCBubbleViewIn appearance] setBubbleTypeIn:SC_BUBBLE_IN_IOS7];
    [[SCBubbleViewOut appearance] setBubbleTypeOut:SC_BUBBLE_OUT_IOS7];

    // Set the bubble color
    [[SCBubbleViewOut appearance] setBaseColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:89./255. green:166./255. blue:249./255. alpha:0.69]];
    [[SCBubbleViewIn appearance] setBaseColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:89./255. green:166./255. blue:249./255. alpha:0.69]];

    The following new shapes are available:
    - SC_BUBBLE_IN_DEFAULT : Standard bubble similar to the bubble shape used by Facebook iOS app
    - SC_BUBBLE_IN_HANGOUT : Bubble Shape similar to Google Hangout iOS App
    - SC_BUBBLE_IN_WHAZZUPP : Bubble Shape similar to a popular messenger
    - SC_BUBBLE_IN_IOS7 : iOS7 style bubble


- Add great photo effects to your photos before sending them. Apply stickers, frames and color effects to your photos with only a single line of code.

In order to use photo effects in your app, you need to prepare your app with the following additional steps

1. Add R1PhotoEffectsSDK.a from the SDK Folder 3rdpartylibs/photoeffects to your project
2. Add CoreText Framework to your project
3. Add the following linker options to "other Linker Flags" : -ObjC
4. In our AppDelegate set the following property:
    self.usePhotoEffects = SC_PHOTO_USERCHOICE;

    3 values are possible here:
        - SC_PHOTO_NOEFFECTS : No effects will be applied
        - SC_PHOTO_APPLYEFFECTS : Always apply photo effects when sending a picture message
        - SC_PHOTO_USERCHOICE : A popup menu allows the user to choose whether he wants to applay a photo effect, after capturing an image.

    This affects the default behavior of our Chat Components and of the following methods:
    
    -(void) captureImageFromAlbumWithQuality:(UIImagePickerControllerQualityType)quality andCompleteAction:(void (^)(NSString *key)) completion
    -(void) captureImageFromCameraWithQuality:(UIImagePickerControllerQualityType)quality andCompleteAction:(void (^)(NSString *key)) completion;
    -(void) captureMediaFromImagePicker:(UIImagePickerController *) imagePicker andCompleteAction:(void (^)(NSString *key)) completion;

    If you want to directly control the photo capture with effects, use the following new methods:
    
    -(void) captureImageFromAlbumWithQuality:(UIImagePickerControllerQualityType)quality andCompleteAction:(void (^)(NSString *key)) completion usingPhotoEffects:(SCPhotoEffects) useEffects;
    -(void) captureImageFromCameraWithQuality:(UIImagePickerControllerQualityType)quality andCompleteAction:(void (^)(NSString *key)) completion usingPhotoEffects:(SCPhotoEffects) useEffects;
    -(void) captureMediaFromImagePicker:(UIImagePickerController *) imagePicker andCompleteAction:(void (^)(NSString *key)) completion usingPhotoEffects:(SCPhotoEffects) useEffects;
    
    Just have a try. All sample code apps using image capture have been updated to offer using photo effects.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug in video call: the picture was turned upside down when rotating to landscape 
- Fixed many smaller issues


IMPORTANT NOTE:

Sometimes, the wrong C2CallDataModel is pre-selected, which causes a crash.

2. Please manually add the following files to your "Copy Bundle Resources" section in your Application Target Build Phases:
    myshader.vsh
    myshader.fsh
Just seek for myshader and drag&drop it into your "Copy Bundle Resources" section. This is important as the files will not be copied into your Application Bundle by default at compile time.
The video call does not work in this case.

Although this SDK is in early beta status, the C2Call technology behind is based C2Call's FriendCaller service with more than 11 Million users.
Therefore all core services like VoIP und Video calls, Instant Messaging is proven technology for many Years now.
Nevertheless, all GUI components have been completely rewritten for this SDK so that they follow the latest iOS standard based on iOS SDK 6.0 and iOS Storyboard.
This ensures an easy switch to iOS 7 which will be support as one of the next steps in our beta cycle.

All GUI components can be customized by copying single components from our SCStoryboard (the storyboard shipped with the SDK) into your main storyboard.
For copying we recommend to always copy all connected components from a block.
The customization of those components should be done then in your Main Storyboard by modifying the GUI and sub classing the component View Controller classes.

To start with the SDK, do the following:

1. Register a developer account at http://sdk.c2call.com
2. Download the SDK and the sample code
3. Get familiar with the documentation and the sample code.
4. Build the sample code and run it.
5. Create your own App. Use the video tutorial and the start-up guide to prepare your project.

For call notifications and messages in background, C2Call uses Apple Push Notifications.

Known issues:
- The API isn't complete yet. 
- The GUI Components didn't get a real field test yet.
- The design of the GUI components is not final yet.
- When adding the SocialCommunication.framework to a project, the Core Data C2CallDataModel does not pre-select the latest data model (C2CallDataModel11.xcdatamodel). This causes a crash when receiving messages. Please manually select the correct data model then.
